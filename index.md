## Welcome to My profile

Hi, I am Yiyi Lin (Bleve), I am a technology lover and I want to share my past with you.

### 2017-04 The First Internship in my life

First time always hard to forget. At that time, I was assigned to do Front-End Developer job. The small IT team only got four people there. And I was helping them build up their admin system by using Vue and Angular framework.


Thanks to all the people there, they helped me a lot and make me become able to work independently.

### 2017-08 Contract Job? Wow!

I never imagine that I can get a contract job so soon even though I am just a student. That was a big surprise and I got an ABN number at that time so I work as a contract web developer. I was using WordPress and WIX at that time.


### 2018-01 My true desire: Software Developer

I leave the last job when the contact finish. And seeking for something more challenging. It is Software Developer, I learned how to using C#, C++ to write the software which is much more complex than JavaScript, PHP and HTML. The client need some small self-use program for manage stuffs or staffs :). And my job is to help achieve them.
